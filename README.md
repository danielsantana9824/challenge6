## Challenge 6: Weather Search Application

## Description

This project is a website that allows users to search for the weather in any city. The site provides up-to-date weather information using data fetched from an API.

## Motivation: 

The goal of this project was to improve my logical thinking and practice JavaScript by dynamically creating elements and working with external APIs.

## Why was this project built?:

 I built this project to enhance my programming skills, practice integrating APIs, and expand my ability to search for solutions and resources on the internet.

## Problem Solved:

 This website allows users to easily search for and view the current weather in any city, making it convenient for people to check the weather in various locations.

## What did I learn?: 

Through this project, I improved my JavaScript skills, specifically in using APIs, manipulating the DOM, and implementing dynamic features.
